# 🥒 TryHackMe - Pickle Rick CTF Walkthrough

This is a simple write-up for the Pickle Rick room on TryHackMe. The goal is to find three flags in a vulnerable web server and understand basic CTF enumeration and exploitation techniques.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Enumerate the target machine  
- Exploit the web application  
- Gain access to the system  
- Retrieve all 3 flags

---

## 🔍 Reconnaissance

Performed an initial scan with:

nmap -sV -p- <target-ip>

Discovered open port: 80/tcp - Apache httpd 2.4.41

Accessing the website showed a basic Rick & Morty themed page with the message: Rick is sup4r cool

🕵️ Directory Bruteforce

Used Gobuster to find hidden paths:

gobuster dir -u http://<target-ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Found:

    /robots.txt → contains the string: Wubbalubbadubdub

    /login.php

    /clue.txt → revealed the username: R1ckRul3s

🔐 Login Panel

Used the credentials:

Username: R1ckRul3s
Password: Wubbalubbadubdub

Login successful.
💻 Command Execution

The post-login interface accepts system commands. I used it as a pseudo shell.

Example:

ls
cat <file>

🔑 Flags:

  First Flag: cat /home/rick/first_flag.txt

  Second Flag: cat /var/www/html/assets/second_flag.txt

  Third Flag: cat /root/third_flag.txt

🧪 Lessons Learned:

    - Importance of brute-forcing directories

    - Basic command injection

    - Manual file enumeration

    - Simple privilege escalation
